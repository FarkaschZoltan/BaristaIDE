Hello, my name is Zolt√°n Farkasch, and this is the Barista IDE, my thesis-project for my Bachelor's degree in computer science.

My aim is to create an intuitive, easy to use but still powerful Java-only (at least for now) IDE, with all the basic functionalities that an IDE should have (syntax-highlighting, git-integration etc.). After my thesis is done, the plan is to work on more interesting new features, without bloating the program, and adding unnecessary bells and whistles.

The app is created using mainly the JavaFX library (with some Java Spring sprinkled in). The highlighting (and maybe other features in the future) is done using JavaScript, but I'm focussing on doing as much as possible with Java.

As of writing this (2022.02.17), the app is still very early in development with key features still missing. Have a look around, nevertheless :).
